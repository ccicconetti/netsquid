# 001 - Scheduling and path selection

Experiments with difference quantum routing metrics and scheduling policies.

## Installation and requirements

For the installation of required packates, see the Dependencies section in the root README.md file.

Before running the scripts in this directory, enter the virtual environment created according
to the instructions there:

```
source myvenv/bin/activate
cd experiments/001-Scheduling-and-path-selection
```

Check that you loaded the environment is well configured by running, e.g.:

```
python export.py -h
```

which should print the command-line help of the `export.py` script.

## Structure

Experiments:

- `first_calibration.py`: experiments to calibrate link lengths and quantum noise parameters
- `first_disc.py`: experiments in a disc topology
- `first_grid.py`: experiments in a grid topology without multipath routing
- `first_grimp.py`: experiments in a grid topology with multipath routing
- `first_gridmpvar.py`: experiments in a grid topology with variable link length with multipath routing

Utilities:

- `first_calibration_plot.py`: produces plot with data generated by `first_calibration.py`
- `first_disc_lenrate.py`: post-processing of the `first_disc.py` results
- `manip.py`: post-processing script
- `run_simulation.py`: defines function `run_simulation` used by all scenarios

## Results

After setting up the environment you can generated the entire set of results by running

```
run_all.sh
```

Execution may require several hours on a standard PC. You can download the results from [this link](http://turig.iit.cnr.it/~claudio/public/netsquid-results-001.tgz) (272 MB).

The raw data can be post-processed by running:

```
export_all.sh
```

which will produce one directory starting with `results-`.

A selection of graphs can be generated by entering the `graphs` directory and loading the scripts in there with [Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/).
